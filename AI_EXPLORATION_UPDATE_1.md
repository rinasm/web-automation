 now the AI Explore is working fine for the 1st time and generating the journey fine, but when I click "AI Explore" again it is going through the same journey and giving it some different title, this is not what I'm expecting when the system itself is AI powered, this can be done with simple javascript, what I'm expecting from AI is a more intelligent way of exploring the application like a human. Let's reengineer this based on below content

- When the AI Explore starts, first it should scan the page create list of interactable
  inputs based on the URL and the previous actions title (if there is no previous action
  the you can appent the URL with _default), this way AI doesn't need to scan the same page again. We can use the "Auto Journey" logic to find all the interactible elements and pass it to AI with context of each element to find the meaningful interactable elements.

    example: 
    1. User is current at host/dashboard
    2. User clicks on "AI Explore"
    3. (findInteractableElements) Auto Journey logic scans the page and find all interactible elements and AI filters the meaningful interactible elements, Before starting the "findInteractableElements" action, it will first always check if the page has been already scanned, and if it is scanned then it will jump to step 5 "findNextAction" using the previously scanned information stored in the db.
    4. (findMeaningfulElements) System stores the interactable element's map based on the URL and the append previous action or append "_default" if there is no previous action. In this case for example
      
      AIJourneys: {
        "host/dashboard_default" : {
          parent: "null",
          interactableElements: [
            {... } // list of all elements detected by Auto Journey logic (no need of saving too much information about the element, just some context, xpath, type of element, and labels etc)
          ],
          meaningfulElements: [
            {... } // list of elements filtered by AI by passing the context of the page and the "interactableElements" detected by Auto Journey logic.
          ],
          pageContext: []
        }
      }

      in response to this request of filtering the "meaningfulElements" from the "interactableElements", AI will response back with a list of "meaningfulElements" along with the "pageContext", The "pageContext" is the summary of the page generated by AI itself in the previous step so that AI can reuse this information efficiently.

      The filteration process is very important to filter out redundant interactable elements, for example if we are in a dashboard and if there is a list of transactions, then the AI doesn't consider all the transaction as a meaningfulElement since testing click on each transaction will endup in same journey. AI must filterout such cases.

    5. (findNextAction) Now the system will pass the meaningfulElements of the page with context of the page to the AI to find next steps whether to click somewhere or fill some dummy details etc. 
    
    For example

      Request should be having these information
      {
        meaningfulElements: [...],
        pageContext: [...],
        currentJourney: [...] // this will be an empty array for the first time since not actions have done by AI yet.
      }

      Response should be having details of the next steps whether to click on some element or conclude journey

    6. (doAction) Now based on the AI response the system will either execute a new action or it will conclude the journey completion. In this case the AI will respond with some action since the journey is not complete.
    7. Once one actions is done, it will repeat the process from step 3 "findInteractableElements" until a jounrey is complete.

- Now when the user clicks on the "AI Explore" again, first it will check if this current page is already scanned based on the logic written in "findInteractableElements"

- After each node is created, it should update the "parentNode" as previous node and in the previous node, the current node should be appended in the children (array).

  for example.

  1. user is at "host/dashboard" and AI generated some "meaningfulElements"
  AIJourneys: {
    "host/dashboard_default": {
      parent: '',
      meaningfulElements: [
        {
          type: 'button',
          label: 'account details',
          context: 'some basic context',
          xpath: '<button xpath>',
          visited: false
        }
      ...],
      interactableElements: [...],
      pageContext: [...]
    }
  }
  2. Now the AI has requested click action on "account details" and it went to account details page. Now we will update the visited flag of the element as true

  AIJourneys: {
    "host/dashboard_default": {
      parent: '',
      meaningfulElements: [
        {
          type: 'button',
          label: 'account details',
          context: 'some basic context',
          xpath: '<button xpath>',
          visited: true,
        }
      ...],
      interactableElements: [...],
      pageContext: [...],
    }
  }
  3. now the system repeats the scanning process in the current page after making the previous action. now the AIJourneys will be

  AIJourneys: {
    "host/dashboard_default": {
      parent: '',
      meaningfulElements: [
        {
          type: 'button',
          label: 'account details',
          context: 'some basic context',
          xpath: '<button xpath>',
          visited: true,
        }
      ...],
      interactableElements: [...],
      pageContext: [...],
      children: [
        "host/dashboard/account-details_accountdetails"
      ]
    },
    "host/dashboard/account-details_accountdetails": {
      parent: 'host/dashboard_default',
      meaningfulElements: [
        {
          type: 'button',
          label: 'transaction details',
          context: 'some basic context',
          xpath: '<button xpath>',
          visited: true
        }
      ...],
      interactableElements: [...],
      pageContext: [...]
    }
  }

  here we have added two things, one is in the "host/dashboard/account-details_accountdetails" key, it is actually <URL>_<PREVIOUS_ACTION>, where URL is host/dashboard/account-details and the PREVIOUS_ACTION is "accountdetails" which is the button label whitespace trimmed which is the cause of previous action.

- After making each "findInteractableElements" and "findMeaningfulElements" action, the glabal map of the application "AIJourneys" should be updated. so the whole map of the application Journey can be created based on that.

- After each journey completion, the effected element in the "meaningfulElements" should be marked as visited, so the AI can detect if the journey has been created before, if an element in "meaningfulElements" is both marked as visited and has no child then AI should stop exploring that path.
